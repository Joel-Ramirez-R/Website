      <h1>Customer Service Quality Control & Performance Dashboard</h1>
    
      <p class="lead">
        I developed an end-to-end Quality Control and Customer Satisfaction monitoring system designed to evaluate the performance of multiple service departments 
        after every customer interaction. The project centralized feedback from various stages of the service process — from quotation and response times to installation 
        and maintenance — allowing the company to accurately measure service quality across Engineering, Field Services, and the Help Desk team.
      </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    
        <p>
          Customers received a short evaluation form after each completed service or installation, where they rated their experience with each department and answered 
          specific questions related to timeliness, communication, and overall satisfaction. All responses were collected and transformed into a unified analytics model.
        </p>
    
        <p>The final dashboard provided managers with complete visibility over:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Average customer satisfaction scores</li>
          <li>Response times, quotation times, installation times, and service times</li>
          <li>Performance analysis by employee</li>
          <li>Department-level comparisons to identify strengths and improvement opportunities</li>
          <li>Trends in customer satisfaction over time</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          This solution allowed department leaders to clearly understand customer perception, track service quality metrics in real time, and make data-driven decisions 
          to improve operational efficiency and customer experience.
        </p>
