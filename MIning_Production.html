  <h1>Mining Production Automation & Mineral Performance Dashboard</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    I designed and implemented a fully automated reporting solution for a mining company to track and analyze the production of multiple minerals. 
    Previously, all mineral production data was captured manually, making it difficult for the Production Administration department to maintain accurate 
    records, generate timely reports, and present reliable information to upper management.
  </p>

  <div class="project-content">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The new solution automated the entire data capture and analytics process, allowing the company to monitor mineral production on a daily, 
      weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. The system also included performance comparisons across three key metrics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Actual Production</li>
      <li>Target (Goal)</li>
      <li>Forecast (Projected Output)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This structure enabled the organization to clearly identify production trends, variances, and gaps between expected and real output. 
      By centralizing all information into an analytical dashboard, the administrative team gained greater visibility and eliminated manual effort 
      involved in consolidating multiple spreadsheets.
    </p>

    <p>The final dashboard allowed management to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Compare performance against targets and forecasts</li>
      <li>Identify fluctuations in production across different periods</li>
      <li>Improve operational planning and resource allocation</li>
      <li>Present cleaner, more accurate data to directors for decision-making</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This project significantly improved the company’s productivity, accuracy, and confidence in their production reporting process.
    </p>

      <li>Define reporting needs and production KPIs with stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Automate data extraction and preparation.</li>
      <li>Create the data model with relationships, targets, and forecast logic.</li>
      <li>Design interactive dashboards for mineral performance analysis.</li>
