      <h1>Financial and Billing Oversight for a CNC Machinery Firm</h1>
      <p class="lead">The purpose of this project was to support the Finance department by automating the billing process, 
        which was previously performed manually for the Services, Engineering, and Sales departments.</p>

      <div class="project-content">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The solution involved building an automated billing report that consolidates and displays accurate information on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly invoicing. 
            This automation eliminated approximately 60 hours of manual work per month and allows managers to access the report at any time, without having to wait until the end of the month. 
            In addition, the report provides detailed analysis by product and service categories, highlighting those with the highest billing volumes. 
            A dedicated view was also created to analyze billing consumption by customer, enabling deeper insights and supporting data-driven decision-making.".</p>
