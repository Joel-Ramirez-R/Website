      <h1>Sales Monitoring Dashboard for a Company Specialized in Hydraulic and Solar Equipment</h1>
      <p class="lead">The objective of this project is to accurately measure the performance of each field sales representative, as well as their corresponding region and zone. 
        The solution tracks key performance indicators such as accumulated sales, global sales targets, progress percentage, daily sales, monthly sales comparison, and average daily sales.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Previously, this analysis was performed manually by extracting data from SAP into Excel and generating month-to-month comparisons, 
          which consumed 48 hours of manual work per month. The new automated approach eliminates this manual effort, ensures data consistency, 
          and provides real-time visibility into sales performance across all levels of the organization. 
          As part of this improvement, 87 sales representatives now receive and review their sales status on a weekly basis, allowing for timely insights and better decision-making.</p>
